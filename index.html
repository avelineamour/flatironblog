        <h3 class="post1">How I Found My Way to Web Development</h3>
        <p class="blog">I first became interested in web development when I was seven years old. I learned some basic HTML through Neopets, which had HTML lessons at the time and was geared towards kids. My main purpose in learning was to be able to make a guild page, since that was common practice on the site at the time. I've always been a very aesthetically oriented person and my motivations for web development now are the same as they were then -- to make beautiful websites that serve a greater purpose. My dad is a senior network engineer now and though he hadn't yet become one at the time, he was always interested in computers. We had the original Apple computer in our house, followed by the colored iMacs and iBooks. He helped me self-host my site using dynDNS, which I adorably named "smileyz". I set background and font colors, added some images, and called it a day. I remember a look of shock on my first grade computer teacher's face when I showed him. Unfortunately, after that I did not continue to learn web design or development. However in the time between then and now, I have been the go-to tech person for friends and coworkers-- always enthusiastic about removing malware, optimizing computer speeds, and generally solving problems that arise. I love technology and I love making things work. My interest in web development is very goals based. In high school we had the option of an alternative style of learning math called Math IMP (Interactive Math Program). Everything was framed in terms of real life problems and applications. We were always applying math towards concrete purposes (a basic example would be when you have kids think of addition in terms of apples). This greatly helped me to do and understand math. I apply web development similarly. I have a purpose and web development is the way to get there.<br/><br/>

        For the past couple years, I have owned a business-- a private practice in orthopedic massage therapy. I've had to do my own marketing and I consider a business' website to be the most integral part of their representation. I believe in the power and importance of your website and your brand. I read a book called <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Subliminal-Your-Unconscious-Rules-Behavior/dp/0307472256">Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior (How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior)</a></i> that demonstrates through scientific studies how certain factors influence the unconscious mind. They can influence the amount of value we attribute to something, even if there's no real logical basis for it. One of those factors is visual representation. Today so many companies and blogs are on their web design game that it's important to keep up. I was very excited to design my website, but did not know how to do it from scratch, so I used Squarespace. I found that when it came to anything visual pertaining to my business that I wanted to do everything myself. I had no Adobe or design experience, but I learned some basics and made my own automated email templates, instagram templates, and business cards. I was having a lot of fun and that inspired me to start a blog.<br/><br/>

        Starting a blog was something that I had wanted to do for a long time. Design for me is an act for self expression, so having my own space on the web has always been enticing. I created a blog with a name and an underlying concept, but wanted to be able to control all aspects of the design. I put it on pause and took the Build Websites from Scratch Pro Intensive course through Codecademy and thus my journey into web development began. It crystallized how much I enjoy doing it and how much more I want to learn, including how the back end functions and how I could create a site from scratch that took in data like email lists, user info, etc. After Build Websites, I started Build Front End Web Apps From Scratch (also through Codecademy) and began learning Javascript. I have fallen in love with all the possibilities. In November I began Flatiron's Online Web Development program and can't wait to share what I learn.
